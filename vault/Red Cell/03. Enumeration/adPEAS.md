### Overview
---
adPEAS is a Powershell tool to automate Active Directory enumeration. In fact, adPEAS is like a wrapper for different other cool projects like

- PowerView
- PoshADCS
- Bloodhound
- and some own written lines of code

As said, adPEAS is a wrapper for other tools. They are almost all written in pure Powershell but some of them are included as compressed binary blob or C# code.

adPEAS-Light is a version without Bloodhound and it is more likely that it will not blocked by an AV solution.
