### [01. Active Directory (AD)](./01.%20Active%20Directory%20(AD)/index.md)
- Active Directory (AD) is a Microsoft directory service that centralizes network management, enabling the organization to securely manage and authenticate users, computers, and resources in a Windows environment.
### [02. IEEE 802.11 (Wireless LAN)](./02.%20IEEE%20802.11%20(Wireless%20LAN)/index.md)
- IEEE 802.11, commonly known as Wi-Fi, is a set of standards for wireless local area networks (LANs) that facilitate wireless communication between devices, enabling wireless internet access and local network connections.
### [03. Enumeration](./03.%20Enumeration/index.md)
- Enumeration is the process of gathering information about a target, such as network services, user accounts, or system configurations, to identify potential vulnerabilities for exploitation.
### [04. Privilege Escalation](./04.%20Privilege%20Escalation/index.md)
- Privilege escalation is the act gaining higher levels of access or permissions on a computer system or network in order to perform actions that would normally be restricted.
### [05. Tunneling & Lateral Movement](./05.%20Tunneling%20&%20Lateral%20Movement/index.md)
- Tunneling (specifically proxying) is a technique that facilitates secure data transfer through encrypted channels, often used for lateral movement within a compromised network. It allows attackers to navigate by moving through an intermediate target to gain access to further network resources while evading detection.
### [06. File Transfers](./06.%20File%20Transfers/index.md)
- File transferring is the process of moving files or data between different systems, either within the same network or across networks for exfiltrating sensitive information or delivering malware.
### [07. Payloads](./07.%20Payloads/index.md)
- Payloads are the specific code in an attack (generally initial access) aimed at performing a specific actions on a targeted system, such as delivering malware, executing exploits, or enabling unauthorized access.
### [08. Defense Evasion](./08.%20Defense%20Evasion/index.md)
- Defense evasion encompasses a range of techniques to circumvent or disable security measures, such as intrusion detection systems or antivirus software, allowing unhindered/undetected action on a target.
### [09. Credential Dumping](./09.%20Credential%20Dumping/index.md)
- Credential dumping involves extracting and collecting user login credentials or password hashes from a compromised system, allowing unauthorized access to additional network resources.
### [10. Persistence](./10.%20Persistence/index.md)
- Persistence is the technique of maintaining unauthorized access to a compromised system or network over an extended period, ensuring continued control and the ability to carry out activities even after initial access has been achieved.
### [11. Web Exploitation](./11.%20Web%20Exploitation/index.md)
- Web exploitation involves the identification and exploitation of vulnerabilities within web applications or services to gain unauthorized access, steal data, or deliver malicious payloads.
### [12. SQL](./12.%20SQL/index.md)
- SQL, or Structured Query Language, is a domain-specific programming language used for managing and manipulating relational databases, allowing for tasks like data retrieval, modification, and administration.
### [13. Industrial Control Systems (ICS)](./13.%20Industrial%20Control%20Systems%20(ICS)/index.md)
- ICS, or Industrial Control Systems, encompasses various types of control systems used in industrial and critical infrastructure settings. These systems are designed to control and monitor physical processes, machinery, and devices.
### [14. Cheatsheets](./14.%20Cheatsheets/index.md)
- This section covers the TL;DR (Too Long; Didn't Read) notes of different toolsets.  Instead of reading large and verbose wikis, this will give you a simple introduction.
### [15. Technique Ted Talks (TTTs)](./15.%20Technique%20Ted%20Talks%20(TTTs)/index.md)
- Technique Ted Talks (TTTs) is a miscellaneous section containing notes covering an overview of/introduction to topics that may be implied (or not implicitly covered in depth) in other notes.
