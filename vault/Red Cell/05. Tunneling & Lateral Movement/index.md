# Tunneling & Lateral Movement
---
- Tunneling (specifically proxying) is a technique that facilitates secure data transfer through encrypted channels, often used for lateral movement within a compromised network. It allows attackers to navigate by moving through an intermediate target to gain access to further network resources while evading detection.
