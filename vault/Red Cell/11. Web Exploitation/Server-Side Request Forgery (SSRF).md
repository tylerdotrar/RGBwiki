---
Server Side Request Forgery or SSRF is a vulnerability in which an attacker forces a server to perform requests on their behalf.

### Tools
---

- [SSRFmap](https://github.com/swisskyrepo/SSRFmap)
```shell
# Installation
git clone https://github.com/swisskyrepo/SSRFmap
cd SSRFmap
pip3 install -r requirements.txt

# Usage
python ./ssrfmap.py
```

- [See-SURF](https://github.com/In3tinct/See-SURF)
```shell
# Installation
git clone https://github.com/In3tinct/See-SURF.git
cd See-SURF/
pip3 install BeautifulSoup4
pip3 install requests

# Usage
python ./see-sruf.py -H <url>
```

- Once SSRF is validated, search for potential backend services normally only available on localhost
