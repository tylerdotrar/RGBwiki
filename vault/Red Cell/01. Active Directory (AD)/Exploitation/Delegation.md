## What is Delegation?
---
Delegation rights allow a system to store the TGT of any account that authenticates to it in its memory.  Then with this stored ticket, they can request access to specified resources within the domain on behalf of the end-user that has authenticated to it.

## Types of Delegation
---
#### Unconstrained Delegation
Unconstrained Delegation rights allow a service to authenticate on a user's behalf to any service or system within the entire domain without restrictions, which means that it has broad, unconstrained access.

#### Constrained Delegation
Constrained Delegation rights restrict delegation to specific systems or services in the domain, allowing a service to authenticate on a user's behalf to only the systems explicitly configured (e.g., access to a specific File Server).

#### Resource-Based Constrained Delegation
Resource-Based Constrained Delegation rights further refines the scope of delegation by allowing a service to authenticate on a user's behalf to only the specific resources on systems explicitly configured (e.g., CIFS access on a specific Domain Computer).
