### TL;DR
---
AS-REP roasting is an attack technique that targets domain accounts with Kerberos Pre-Authentication disabled.

Domain accounts with Kerberos pre-authentication disabled do not have to encrypt their AS-REQ  (Authentication Service Request) with their shared secret (aka their NTLM password), meaning attackers can request and acquire a TGT on behalf of these users without knowing their credentials.
